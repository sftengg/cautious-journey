# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

Analyzed Seattle Airbnb dataset using python (ipython notebook) libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, Sklearn.

## Motivation and Objective

Project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program and the objective of this analysis is to find out various aspects that are influencing the prices at Airbnb rentals. How does seasonality effect the pricing and also coming up with a model that help  to predict the price based on the chosen features. And CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) method has been followed for this study.
